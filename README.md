## UO Library Data Services Winter 2021 Workshop Materials

This repo includes scripts and presentations from:

 - Introduction to the Unix Command-line

 - Introduction to Python

 - Data Science with Python

These are all two-session workshops, with each session
lasting 1.5 hours (1hr for lecture, ~30min for questions).

All can easily be expanded on to develop into larger workshops.

Much of the material in these workshops was adapted from the 
**Software Carpentries** lessons: https://software-carpentry.org/lessons/
